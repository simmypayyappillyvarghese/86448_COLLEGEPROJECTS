<h3>Pine cone Collection:</h3>
<!--Italics and bold style applied to span elements in style.css-->
<span>Pine cone collection</span> was inspired by a look inward at self, nature, and balance. Throughout history and across cultures, pine cones have been symbolic of inner growth, and the third eye. A pine cone is an amazing feat of nature that is organized in a very predictable geometric pattern which is not always immediately obvious. Studying a pine cone gives you the satisfaction of finding order in something that can at first appear chaotic. The intricacies and complex nature of the pine cone, both aesthetically and symbolically, were difficult to process and translate into simple styles and unique pieces of jewellery.

<h3>Coral Collection:</h3>
<span>Coral Collection</span> is a departure from our signature sticks and stones pieces. This collection incorporates the various textures and form of a single piece of coral. The Coral Collection is a striking juxtaposition of simplicity and intricate detail. These pieces will ignite the urge in all of us to get to the beach and find our own treasures!

<h3>The Nest collection:</h3> These pieces are representations of the beautiful sculptural homes created by birds. The Nest pieces are one-of-a-kind. I build each one out of wax and then cast them.
