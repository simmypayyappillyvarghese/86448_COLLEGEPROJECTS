<span>FOR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE USA</span><br>

Zingaari offers a full statutory warranty covering manufacturing and material defects for genuine branded Zingaari products purchased from Zingaari own stores (including Online) or authorized Zingaari retailers. The terms of the warranty may vary between markets and regions. The warranty only covers damage that in the opinion of Zingaari or an authorized Zingaari  retailer is not caused by accident or inappropriate use, ordinary wear and tear, modification, attempted repair, negligence or by failure to follow Zingaari's special product Care Advice. 
Every item found to be defective under this warranty may be, at the discretion of Zingaari or an authorized Zingaari retailer: 
<ol>
<li>replaced by an identical piece, if available:</li> 
<li>substituted with a piece of comparable value; or </li>
<li>repaired depending on the degree of damage to the warranted product as well as on the feasibility and the availability of replacement parts.</li> 
</ol>
<br>
The damaged product should be given to the closest Zingaari Shop or an authorized Zingaari retailer that will send it to the local Zingaari sales company. If products are sent by mail, they should be insured and sent by certified or registered mail, as Zingaari cannot be held liable for damage, loss, or theft incurred during transport.
